# Ezeassist: Voice-Controlled IoT Assistant



Ezeassist is an exciting **Internet of Things (IoT)** project that combines hardware components, cloud APIs, and artificial intelligence to create a voice-controlled assistant. Whether you want to automate your home, monitor environmental conditions, or simply impress your friends, Ezeassist has got you covered.

## Features

1. **Voice Recognition and Interaction**:
   - Utilize two **ESP32** microcontrollers for voice processing and communication.
   - Speak commands to control connected devices, get weather updates, and more.

2. **Hardware Components**:
   - **ESP32 Boards**: These powerful microcontrollers serve as the brains of our assistant.
   - **Microphone Module**: Captures voice input.
   - **Speaker and Amplifier**: Provides audio output.

3. **Cloud APIs Integration**:
   - **ChatGPT API**: Engage in natural language conversations with your assistant.
   - **Google Cloud Services**: Leverage APIs for weather data, speech recognition, and more.

## Getting Started

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the ESP32 boards, microphone, speaker, and amplifier according to the provided schematics.
   - Ensure proper power supply and wiring.

2. **Software Configuration**:
   - Set up your ESP32 development environment (e.g., PlatformIO, Arduino IDE).
   - Upload the provided firmware to both ESP32 boards.

3. **API Keys and Credentials**:
   - Obtain API keys for ChatGPT and Google Cloud services.
   - Update the configuration files with your credentials.

4. **Run the Assistant**:
